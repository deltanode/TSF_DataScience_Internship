# TSF_DataScience_Internship
This repository contains the scripts/notebooks of various tasks submitted during the Data Science & Analytics Internship at TSF.

- [**Exploratory Data Analysis**](Exploratory_Data_Analysis_Task)

>Analysing Superstore Dataset of the retail firm and finding out the weak areas where we can work to make more profit. Here, we will be exploring insights on how the company is performing. What all business problems we can derive by looking into the data?

- [**Machine Learning**](Machine_Learning_Task)

>In this Supervised Machine Learning task, we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables. What will be predicted score if a student study for 9.25 hrs in a day?

## Libraries

- **Numpy** : 
Numpy is Numerical Python library for doing high level math computations involving complex data structures like matrices.

- **Pandas** : 
Pandas is a great library for Data Science. It provides high level abstraction implementation for analysing the data. Click this [link](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) for its documentation.

- **Seaborn and Matplotlib** : 
Matplotlib is a python library used for visualizing the data. It is used for plotting the data for getting the insights from the data and creating statistical interferences. Seaborn is built on top of matplotlib but can do quite amazing things in the area of visualization - matplotlib works more as a “bare bones” visualization tool.

- **Scikit-learn** : 
Scikit-learn provides a range of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms via a consistent interface in Python.
